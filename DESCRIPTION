Description: Provides a 'PROJ' <https://proj.org> C API that can be 
  used to write high-performance C and C++ coordinate transformation
  operations using R as an interface. This package contains an internal 
  version of the 'PROJ' library to guarantee the best possible 
  consistency on multiple platforms, and to provide a means by which
  'PROJ' can be used on platforms where it may be impractical
  or impossible to install a binary version of the library.
